[![GitHub Actions Status](https://github.com/nathanjmcdougall/usethis-python/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nathanjmcdougall/usethis-python/actions)

Automate Python project setup and development tasks that are otherwise performed manually.

usethis knows about popular Python tools, workflows and frameworks, and knows how they interact. It can declaratively add and remove tools, configure them, and set up the project for you in a way that won't break your existing configuration and it will make the necessary adjustments to your project configuration files.

usethis gives detailed messages about what it is doing (and what you need to do next).

- Output beginning with `✔` represents a task which usethis has automated.
- Output beginning with `☐` represents a task which you need to perform manually.
- Output beginning with `ℹ` gives hints and tips.

Inspired by an [**R** package of the same name](https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html), this package brings a similar experience to the Python ecosystem as a CLI tool.

> [!TIP]
> usethis is great for fresh projects using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv), but also supports updating existing projects. However, this should be considered experimental. If you encounter problems or have feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nathanjmcdougall/usethis-python/issues/new?template=idea.md).

## Highlights

- 🧰 First-class support for state-of-the-practice tooling: uv, Ruff, pytest, pre-commit, and many more.
- 🤖 Automatically add and remove tools: declare, install, and configure in one step.
- 🧠 Powerful knowledge of how different tools interact and sensible defaults.
- 🔄 Update existing configuration files automatically.
- 📢 Fully declarative project configuration.
- ⚡ Get started on a new Python project or a new workflow in seconds.

## 🧭 Getting Started

First, it is strongly recommended you [install the uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): this is a simple, documented process. If you're already using uv, make sure you're using at least
version v0.5.29 (run `uv version` to check, and `uv self update` to upgrade).

> [!TIP]
> At the moment, usethis assumes you will have uv installed in some circumstances. Support for projects that don't use uv is planned for late 2025.

You can install usethis directly into the project environment:

```console
# With uv
$ uv add --dev usethis

# With pip
$ pip install usethis
```

Alternatively, you can also run usethis commands in isolation, using `uvx` or `pipx`. For example, to add Ruff to the project:

```console
# With uv
$ uvx usethis tool ruff

# With pipx
$ pipx run usethis tool ruff
```

## 🖥️ Command Reference

### `usethis tool`

Add a new tool to a Python project, including:

- declared & installed dependencies with `uv add`,
- relevant `pyproject.toml` configuration,
- any other relevant directories or tool-bespoke configuration files, and
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration if using `pre-commit`.

Note if `pyproject.toml` is not present, it will be created, since this is required for
declaring dependencies with `uv add`.

#### Code Quality Tools

- `usethis tool codespell` - Use the [codespell spellchecker](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell): detect common spelling mistakes.
- `usethis tool deptry` - Use the [deptry linter](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry): avoid missing or superfluous dependency declarations.
- `usethis tool import-linter` - Use [Import Linter](https://import-linter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): enforce a self-imposed architecture on imports.
- `usethis tool pre-commit` - Use the [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) framework to manage and maintain pre-commit hooks.
- `usethis tool pyproject-fmt` - Use the [pyproject-fmt linter](https://github.com/tox-dev/pyproject-fmt): opinionated formatting of 'pyproject.toml' files.
- `usethis tool ruff` - Use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff): an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter.

#### Testing

- `usethis tool coverage.py` - Use [Coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy): a code coverage measurement tool.
- `usethis tool pytest` - Use the [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) testing framework.

#### Configuration Files

- `usethis tool pyproject.toml` - Use a [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#writing-your-pyproject-toml) file to configure the project.
- `usethis tool requirements.txt` - Use a [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/) file exported from the uv lockfile.

## 📚 Similar Projects

Not sure if usethis is the exact fit for your project?

The closest match to usethis is [PyScaffold](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffold/). It provides a Command Line Interface to automate the creation of a project from a sensible templated structure.

You could also consider your own hard-coded template. Templating tools such as [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) and [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) allow you to create static templates with fixed configuration you can use across multiple projects. However, it's not always obvious which template you should use, and many do not use state-of-practice tooling such as `pyproject.toml`. Also, sometimes a template can overwhelm you with too many unfamiliar tools.

You could [consider this template](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-uv) which works with Copier, or [this template](https://github.com/johnthagen/python-blueprint) which works with Cookiecutter.

> [!TIP]
> You can still use usethis as a part of a templates using [hooks](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/hooks.html#using-pre-post-generate-hooks-0-7-0) for Cookiecutter and [tasks](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#tasks) for Copier.

If you're using Cookiecutter, then you can update to a latest version of a template using a tool like [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft). Copier has inbuilt support for template updating. Another template-style option which provides updating is [jaraco/skeleton](https://blog.jaraco.com/skeleton/), which is a specific, git-based template rather than a general templating system.

### Roadmap

Major features planned for later in 2025 are:

- Support for users who aren't using uv, e.g. poetry users,
- Support for automated GitHub Actions workflows ([#57](https://github.com/nathanjmcdougall/usethis-python/issues/57)),
- Support for a typechecker (likely Pyright, [#121](https://github.com/nathanjmcdougall/usethis-python/issues/121)), and
- Support for documentation pages (likely using mkdocs, [#188](https://github.com/nathanjmcdougall/usethis-python/issues/188)).

Other features are tracked in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nathanjmcdougall/usethis-python/issues) page.
