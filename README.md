Automate Python project setup and development tasks that are otherwise performed manually.

usethis is a command-line interface to automate the configuration of popular Python tools, workflows, and frameworks. You can use it to declaratively add, remove, and configure tools in an existing project, as well as set up a new project from scratch. It won't break your existing configuration, and ensures all tools work together smoothly.

usethis gives detailed messages about what it is doing (and what you need to do next).

- Output beginning with `✔` represents a task which usethis has automated.
- Output beginning with `☐` represents a task which you need to perform manually.
- Output beginning with `ℹ` gives hints and tips.

Inspired by an [**R** package of the same name](https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html), this package brings a similar experience to the Python ecosystem as a CLI tool.

## Highlights

- 🧰 First-class support for state-of-the-practice tooling: uv, Ruff, pytest, pre-commit, and many more.
- 🤖 Automatically add and remove tools: declare, install, and configure in one step.
- 🧠 Powerful knowledge of how different tools interact and sensible defaults.
- 🔄 Update existing configuration files automatically.
- 📢 Fully declarative project configuration.
- ⚡ Get started on a new Python project or a new workflow in seconds.

## 🧭 Installation

First, it is strongly recommended you [install the uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): this is a simple, documented process. If you're already using uv, make sure you're using at least
version v0.8.18 (run `uv --version` to check, and `uv self update` to upgrade).

You can install usethis directly into the project environment:

```console
# With uv
$ uv add --dev usethis

# With pip
$ pip install usethis
```

Alternatively, you can also run usethis commands in isolation, using `uvx` or `pipx`. For example, to add Ruff to the project:

```console
# With uv
$ uvx usethis tool ruff

# With pipx
$ pipx run usethis tool ruff
```

## 📜 Documentation

## 💡 Example Usage

### Starting a new project

To start a new project from scratch with a complete set of recommended tooling, simply run
the `uvx usethis init` command.

### Configuring individual tools

You can also configure individual tools one-by-one. For example, to add Ruff on an existing project, run:

```console
$ uvx usethis tool ruff
✔ Adding dependency 'ruff' to the 'dev' group in 'pyproject.toml'.
✔ Adding Ruff config to 'pyproject.toml'.
✔ Selecting Ruff rules 'A', 'C4', 'E4', 'E7', 'E9', 'F', 'FLY', 'FURB', 'I', 'PLE', 'PLR', 'RUF', 'SIM', 'UP' in 'pyproject.toml'.
✔ Ignoring Ruff rules 'PLR2004', 'SIM108' in 'pyproject.toml'.
☐ Run 'uv run ruff check --fix' to run the Ruff linter with autofixes.
☐ Run 'uv run ruff format' to run the Ruff formatter.
```

For a detailed breakdown of what each line of the output means, [there is a detailed explanation available](https://usethis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/start/detailed-example).

As another example, to use pytest, run:

```console
$ uvx usethis tool pytest
✔ Adding dependency 'pytest' to the 'test' group in 'pyproject.toml'.
✔ Adding pytest config to 'pyproject.toml'.
✔ Creating '/tests'.
✔ Writing '/tests/conftest.py'.
✔ Selecting Ruff rule 'PT' in 'pyproject.toml'.
☐ Add test files to the '/tests' directory with the format 'test_*.py'.
☐ Add test functions with the format 'test_*()'.
☐ Run 'uv run pytest' to run the tests.
```

There are also commands to configure aspects other than tools. For example, to configure [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/features/pipelines), run:

```console
$ uvx usethis ci bitbucket
✔ Writing 'bitbucket-pipelines.yml'.
✔ Adding cache 'uv' definition to 'bitbucket-pipelines.yml'.
✔ Adding 'Run Ruff' to default pipeline in 'bitbucket-pipelines.yml'.
✔ Adding 'Test on 3.13' to default pipeline in 'bitbucket-pipelines.yml'.
✔ Adding 'Test on 3.14' to default pipeline in 'bitbucket-pipelines.yml'.
☐ Run your pipeline via the Bitbucket website.
```

See the [CLI Reference](https://usethis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli/reference) for a full list of available commands.

## 📚 Similar Projects

Not sure if usethis is the exact fit for your project?

The closest match to usethis is [PyScaffold](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffold/). It provides a Command Line Interface to automate the creation of a project from a sensible templated structure.

You could also consider your own hard-coded template. Templating tools such as [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) and [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) allow you to create static templates with fixed configuration you can use across multiple projects. However, it's not always obvious which template you should use, and many do not use state-of-practice tooling such as `pyproject.toml`. Also, sometimes a template can overwhelm you with too many unfamiliar tools.

You could consider [this template](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-uv) or [this one](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-uv), which work with Copier, or [this template](https://github.com/johnthagen/python-blueprint) which works with Cookiecutter.

> [!TIP]
> You can still use usethis as a part of a templates using [hooks](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/hooks.html#using-pre-post-generate-hooks-0-7-0) for Cookiecutter and [tasks](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#tasks) for Copier.

If you're using Cookiecutter, then you can update to a latest version of a template using a tool like [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft). Copier has inbuilt support for template updating. Another template-style option which provides updating is [jaraco/skeleton](https://blog.jaraco.com/skeleton/), which is a specific, git-based template rather than a general templating system.

If you're not interested in templating automations, then [configurator](https://github.com/jamesbraza/configurator) provides a list of useful tooling and configuration to consider for your Python projects. If you're adopting a specific framework like Django, FastAPI, Dagster, or Flask, [this list](https://usethis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks) gives options for initializing new projects via CLI.
