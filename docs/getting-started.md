# ðŸ§­ Getting Started

First, it is strongly recommended you [install the uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): this is a simple, documented process. If you're already using uv, make sure you're using at least
version v0.6.8. To check this, run `uv self version` to check (if available, otherwise `uv version`), and run `uv self update` to upgrade.

At the moment, usethis assumes you will have uv installed in some circumstances. Support for projects that don't use uv is planned for late 2025.

You can install usethis directly into the project environment:

```console
# With uv
$ uv add --dev usethis

# With pip
$ pip install usethis
```

Alternatively, you can also run usethis commands in isolation, using `uvx` or `pipx`. For example, to add Ruff to the project:

```console
# With uv
$ uvx usethis tool ruff

# With pipx
$ pipx run usethis tool ruff
```
