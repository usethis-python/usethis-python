                     This is purely for documentation and is optional.
        root: A dictionary mapping the file path to the configuration entry.
        managed: Whether this configuration should be considered managed by only this
                 tool, and therefore whether it should be removed when the tool is
                 removed. This might be set to False if we are modifying other tools'
                 config sections or shared config sections that are pre-requisites for
                 using this tool but might be relied on by other tools as well.
        force: Whether to overwrite any existing configuration entry. Defaults to false,
               in which case existing configuration is left as-is for the entry.
        applies_to_all: Whether all file managers should support this config item, or
                        whether it is optional and is only desirable if we know in
                        advance what the file managers are which are being used.

                        It is useful to set this to False when the config item
                        corresponds to the root level config, which isn't always
                        available for non-nested file types like INI. For example,
